It is widely used for prediction and forecasting in various fields such as economics, finance, and science.\n","\n","## 1. What is Linear Regression?\n","Linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable and that this relationship can be represented by a straight line (or hyperplane). Linear regression aims to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes this relationship. \n","\n","### Applications:\n","- **Predicting Exam Scores:** Imagine you have data on students' study hours and their corresponding exam scores. You can use linear regression to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.\n","\n","- **Forecasting House Prices:** Suppose you have data on house sizes (in square feet) and their selling prices. You can use linear regression to predict the selling price of a house based on its size.\n","\n","- **Estimating Gas Mileage:** If you have data on cars' engine sizes and their corresponding gas mileage, you can use linear regression to predict a car's gas mileage based on its engine size.\n","\n","## 2.
